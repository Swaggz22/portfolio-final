<p>With my creative and inspirational designing ability, I am able to refurnish your site or create one that fits your wants &amp; needs. Before I began learning to code websites, I spent some years recording, mixing, and mastering music. As well as shooting music <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/iAmJoeSwaggz">videos</a>. With the knowledge I've obtained in my different areas of expertise, I plan to bring them all together to start a high-quality professional media production company.</p>

<h3>
<a id="my-mission" class="anchor" href="#my-mission" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Mission,..</h3>

<p>Is to provide professional and quality services to those who have a large capacity for creativity but are restricted in funding their passions. Offering low and rewarding prices gives the client and I a chance to be heard. An opportunity to network and grow with your creativity. I believe that dreams are made to be achieved.</p>

<a id="my-expertness" class="anchor" href="#my-expertness" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Expertness,.</h3>

<p>Throughout my time, I've equipped myself with 8+ years of studio recording, mixing, and mastering. Attached to that, I've found myself shooting music videos for some of the music I've engineered or other clients I've come across or worked with before. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iAmJoeSwaggzPhotography/">iAmJoeSwaggz Photography</a> captures breathtaking moments for many different events or occasions.</p>
